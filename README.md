# Vole Machine Language Simulator

## Description:
### In this machine, data is taken as a file of space separated
chars representing the instructions, e.g. 10FF, then apply instructions(Machine Language).

## Machine Components:
### Register: 16 register storage space for units of memory that are used to transfer data for immediate use.
### Memory: 256 cell to store data.
### Instructions: appling some operations in the machine.
### Machine: run the whole program and link it together.

## Machine Language:
1 -->	RXY -->	LOAD the register R with the bit pattern found in the memory cell whose address is XY.
2 --> RXY --> LOAD the register R with the bit pattern XY.
3 --> RXY --> STORE the bit pattern found in register R in the memory cell whose address is XY.
4 --> 0RS --> MOVE the bit pattern found in register R to register S.
5 --> RST --> ADD the bit patterns in registers S and T as though they were twoâ€™s complement representations and leave the result in register R.
6 --> RST --> ADD the bit patterns in registers S and T as though they represented values in floating-point notation and leave the floating-point result in register R.
7 --> RST --> OR the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R.
8 --> RST --> AND the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R.
9 --> RST --> EXCLUSIVE OR the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R.
A --> R0X --> ROTATE the bit pattern in register R one bit to the right X times. Each time place the bit that started at the low-order end at the high-order end.
B --> RXY --> JUMP to the location in the memory cell at address XY if the bit pattern in register R is equal to the bit pattern in register number 0. Otherwise, continue with the normal sequence of execution. (The jump is implemented by copying XY into the program counter during the execute phase.)
C --> 000 --> HALT execution.
