# Vole Machine Language Simulator

## Description:
**In this machine, data is taken as a file of space separated chars representing the instructions, e.g. 10FF, then apply instructions(Machine Language).**

## Machine Components:
- **Register:** 16 register storage space for units of memory that are used to transfer data for immediate use.
- **Memory:** 256 cell to store data.
- **Instructions:** appling some operations in the machine.
- **Machine:** run the whole program and link it together.

## Machine Language:
1 -->	RXY -->	**LOAD** the register R with the bit pattern found in the memory cell whose address is XY. <br>
2 --> RXY --> **LOAD** the register R with the bit pattern XY. <br>
3 --> RXY --> **STORE** the bit pattern found in register R in the memory cell whose address is XY. <br>
4 --> 0RS --> **MOVE** the bit pattern found in register R to register S. <br>
5 --> RST --> **ADD** the bit patterns in registers S and T as though they were twoâ€™s complement representations and leave the result in register R. <br>
6 --> RST --> **ADD** the bit patterns in registers S and T as though they represented values in floating-point notation and leave the floating-point result in register R. <br>
7 --> RST --> **OR** the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R. <br>
8 --> RST --> **AND** the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R. <br>
9 --> RST --> **EXCLUSIVE OR** the bit patterns in registers S and T and place the result in register R. <br>
A --> R0X --> **ROTATE** the bit pattern in register R one bit to the right X times. Each time place the bit that started at the low-order end at the high-order end. <br>
B --> RXY --> **JUMP** to the location in the memory cell at address XY if the bit pattern in register R is equal to the bit pattern in register number 0. Otherwise, continue with the normal sequence of execution (The jump is implemented by copying XY into the program counter during the execute phase.) <br>
C --> 000 --> **HALT** execution. <br>
D --> RXY --> **JUMP** to instruction in RAM cell XY if the content of register R is greater than (>) the content of register 0. Data is interpreted as integers in two's complement notation.
